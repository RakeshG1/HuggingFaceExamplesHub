### Modules

#### Torch

Torch is an open-source machine learning library originally developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is designed for deep learning and is highly popular in the data science community, especially for tasks involving neural networks. The library provides a range of tools and functions to create and train complex models efficiently.

#### NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library in Python for scientific computing and data science. It provides powerful tools for working with multidimensional arrays and matrices, which are essential building blocks for many data science tasks.

#### TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. It is designed for numerical computation using data flow graphs, where nodes represent mathematical operations, and edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It provides a flexible framework for building, training, and deploying a wide range of machine learning models. TensorFlow is widely used for developing and training machine learning and deep learning models, particularly neural networks.

#### tf-keras

It also commonly referred to as Keras with TensorFlow, is a high-level API built on top of TensorFlow that simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models. Keras is a high-level deep learning API written in Python, which runs on top of lower-level deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and easy implementation of neural networks.

#### Flax

Flax is a relatively new but powerful deep learning library built on top of JAX, a high-performance numerical computation library in Python.

#### Transformers

Transformers are a specific type of neural network architecture that have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in data science.

#### NLTK

NLTK, or the Natural Language Toolkit, is a comprehensive library in Python used for working with human language data (text). It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.

#### Textblob

TextBlob is a free, open-source Python library designed specifically for simplifying common Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It offers a user-friendly interface built on top of NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to perform essential text analysis operations, tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
